## Requirements
* You need to get the download the [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and unzip it and change the text in line 5 on `get_names.py` to the location of the chromedriver executable.
* You also need to have the chrome browser
* You need to install selenium, use pip3
`pip3 install selenium`

---
## Steps to run

Type `bash run.sh`

And ignore the chrome browser window that pops up.

And wait for a while, this takes more time than I'd like it to, because to make sure I get all the connections, I'm making it scroll up and down for multiple times as all connections are not loaded at once.

## TODO
* [ ] Fix the up and down scroll thing to make it run faster.
