# LinkedIn-Unfollow
On LinkedIn, connections follow each other by default. Find out who unfollowed you on LinkedIn. 

## Steps to run
Type `bash run.sh`


And wait for a while, this takes more time than I'd like it to, because to make sure I get all the connections, I'm making it scroll up and down for multiple times as not all connections are loaded at once.

## TODO
* [ ] Fix the up and down scroll thing to make it run faster.
